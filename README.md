## How to play:

    1) Send 0.2 ether (exact) to address 0x60Bc6F87D40bfE837F24fcE8EfebaF6391c74E6d
    	1a) If you send more or less than 0.2 ether, the contract will reject the transaction
    2) After 5 people have sent 0.2 ether, the contract chooses one address at random and sends 0.8 ethers to it + 0.2 ethers to Give Directly's address
    3) The lottery restarts
